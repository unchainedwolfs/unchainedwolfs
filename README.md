is a revolutionary web based NFT roleplaying game launched on the Polygon Network. The core of the game revolves around rewarding players with Oxygen 
tokens after completing missions and participating in raids.
They can get additional Wolfs and buy items to increase their overall Attributes. Players can also trade their Wolfs and items on an open marketplace.

In a parallel universe, similar to our Earthâ€™s, there is a planet called Wolfirion. The planet is inhabited by a race called Wolfs. At the beginning everyone was happy, living a healthy life with their environment thriving. Over the years resources run out. Forests were cut down day by day, pollution destroyed the ecosystem and as a result fauna got extinct. All that because of a group of wealthy Wolfs centralized their wellbeing around money. After Armageddon, with everything destroyed their currency had no value anymore. Over the years they had to survive by using everything that was left.
Five tribes formed the resistance, a group of the strongest Wolfs, tried their best to save their planet over the years but it was too late. So, they made a vow to save other planets before its too late. They rushed to create a portal machine to travel to other planets. Unfortunately, the portal machine malfunctioned and they arrived to Earth. Also, from another dysfunction they were imprisoned in a form of NFTs and once again they were chained.
Our purpose is to save them, connect the five tribes and form once again the resistance to help our planet before itâ€™s too late. Unchain your wolf and fight for our planet.
